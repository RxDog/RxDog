Hey, I’m Rx.

I’m a developer focused on solving problems and creating systems that work. I enjoy experimenting and finding new ways to make things run smoother.

What I’m into:
- AI
- Security & Encryption Software
- Data Engineering

Recently, I’ve been working on:
[Pending Project...]

A few things I believe in:
Quality over quantity: I'd rather build fewer, better things.
Continuous learning: If you're not improving, you're standing still.

Want to reach me? You’ll figure it out.😁
